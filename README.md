# Escape Room Drone Game

## Project Description
We have conceptualized a game where a drone embarks from a central "hub" to deliver antidotes to various drop-off locations. The objective is for the player to successfully deliver all the antidotes to win the game. If the player fails to complete the deliveries within the allocated time, the game is lost. A timer will be prominently displayed on screen, making it visible to escape room participants. Importantly, the game is designed to be accessible and relatively easy for an audience of non-gamers. For more in-depth information on the various game components, please refer to the class design documentation.

## Project Organization

This project strictly adheres to the project organization practices recommended by [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/project_organization.html). Please use this as a general guideline. In summary, folders in the file directory should be named using **snake_case**, and nodes should be named with **CamelCase**. If you're uncertain, feel free to ask questions or refer to the practices already implemented in the initial project.

## Git Practices

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, please avoid pushing code directly to the main branch. Instead, it's a good practice to create a branch for the specific feature you're working on. After completing your work, we can utilize merge requests. This approach helps us manage the project effectively and provides a safety net in case we encounter a bug and need to revert changes. When naming these branches, please follow this convention: **"feature_name_development"**. For instance, the commands may be any of the following:
```shell
git branch "feature_name_development"
git checkout "feature_name_development"
```
A shorter version of the above is:
```shell
git checkout -b "feature_name_development"
```
After pushing these changes, they can be merged later.
